# Super Mario-ish Clone

This is a Super Mario-ish game created while I was making myself familiar with the C language again, after working on JavaScript for 6 months straight.This game is not production ready and is merely an enthusiast project.
## Setup
1. You will need the SDL2, SDL2_image and the SDL2_mixer libraries. Install these libraries to enable compilation.

2. Compile and play

### PS: Sorry in advance if the dying sound freaks you out.
